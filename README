zipfor
======

for-each constructs for C++11 that provide iteration over multiple
containers at the same time (zipping, or parallel iteration -- not
parallel computation)

primarily provides zipfor:
--------------------------
can be used as

vector<int> a {1,2,3};
array<string,3> b {"hello","there","coders"};

zipfor(i,s eachin a,b)
	cout << i << " => " << b;


also provides mapfor:
---------------------

map<int,string> m{{1,"hello"},{2,"there"},{-3,"stranger"}};

mapfor(i,s eachin m) 
	cout << i << " => " << b;


Notes:
-----

o This is a header-only "library" so no compilation is necessary.
o It depends heavily on C++11 (it will not work with C++03 or earlier)
o It has been tested on g++4.8.1 but nothing else at this point (Dec 2013)
o It *does* use macros to provide the syntax sugar.
o Any bug reports would be appreciated.
